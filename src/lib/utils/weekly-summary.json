I guess Bones doesn't know as much as they thought. Maybe change that team name to \"Bones Knows Jack.\"\n\nSpeaking of embarrassing scores, how about Burrow This L barely burrow-ing past DaCreamist with 87.12 points? I've seen better numbers on a deli counter. At least DaCreamist can take solace in having a slightly less ridiculous team name.\n\nNow, let's give a round of applause to Matty Ice Tea for putting up a respectable 145.12 against King of Brentwood. Clearly, the iced tea was spiked with something strong this week. Too bad the King couldn't hold court with their measly 114.36.\n\nBut the real shocker? MANDEM CEO demolishing Rotenheimer 126.14 to 90.16. I guess the CEO decided to show up to the office this week. Maybe Rotenheimer should consider changing their name to \"Rotenhimer\" after that pitiful performance.\n\nAll in all, it was a wild week of fantasy highs and lows. Some teams looked like",

Rotenheimer's squad put up a valiant fight, but at the end of the day, they were no match for the juggernaut that is MANDEM CEO.\n\nLet's start with the standouts. Nico Collins and Zay Flowers absolutely torched the field for MANDEM CEO, racking up a combined 49.6 points! Kyler Murray also had himself a day, dropping a cool 28.54 points. On the other side, Brock Purdy and Javonte Williams did their best to keep Rotenheimer in the game, but it just wasn't enough.\n\nNow, for the not-so-great performances. Jerome Ford and Mark Andrews were underwhelming for Rotenheimer, while Zack Moss was a complete dud for MANDEM CEO. But hey, you can't win 'em all, right?\n\nAll in all, it was a lopsided affair, with MANDEM CEO emerging victorious by a massive margin. Better luck next time, Rotenheimer!"

DK Metcalf absolutely went off for Matty Ice Tea, putting up a monster 28.9 points and leading the charge. Jalen Hurts and Hunter Henry also had stellar performances, ensuring Matty Ice Tea would not be denied. \n\nOn the other side, King of Brentwood got solid production from DeVonta Smith and J.K. Dobbins, but it just wasn't enough to keep pace. Josh Allen unfortunately had an off day, which really hampered their chances. The Bengals D/ST tried to pick up the slack with 10 points, but it was too little, too late against the onslaught from Matty Ice Tea's squad. A valiant effort from King of Brentwood, but they'll need their big guns firing on all cylinders next time to take down a juggernaut like Matty Ice Tea."

Rachaad White couldn't even muster 4 points, and Taysom Hill's 2.9 was about as exciting as watching paint dry.\n\nOn the other hand, STROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN showed us that rookies can still make a splash. Jordan Mason and Rashid Shaheed combined for nearly 40 points, while Jaxon Smith-Njigba announced his arrival with a stellar 23.7. Even C.J. Stroud got in on the action with 14.3 points. \n\nBut the real MVP has to be Brandon Aubrey, whose 17 points from the kicker spot was pure money. And let's not forget the Texans D/ST, who made life miserable for the opposition with 16 points of their own.\n\nIn the end, STROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN made a statement with their 128.5 to 108 victory, proving that sometimes the underdog has a bit of bite."

Marty's squad absolutely torched the competition, led by a blistering performance from Malik Nabers at the flex. James Cook and Brock Bowers also ran roughshod over the opposition. On the other side, Bones Knows' players seemed to hit a brick wall, with only Darnell Mooney and the Bills D/ST providing respectable outings. Stefon Diggs and Aaron Jones were ice cold, leaving Bones Knows out in the cold against the blazing hot Marty Cold Cutz.

Meanwhile, Rhamondre Stevenson and the Browns D/ST chipped in with respectable outings. However, the rest of the squad struggled to make a significant impact, with Sam LaPorta and Dak Prescott turning in underwhelming performances.\n\nAs for Nutty Toilets, they had a secret weapon in De'Von Achane, who exploded for a whopping 29.5 points. George Kittle also came through with a solid outing, while Patrick Mahomes did just enough to keep the team competitive. Unfortunately, the likes of Khalil Shakir, DeAndre Hopkins, and the 49ers D/ST couldn't quite match the opposition's firepower. But hey, at least Ka'imi Fairbairn knocked down those extra points like a champ!\n\nIn the end, it was a closely contested battle, but captain beef edged out Nutty Toilets by a razor-thin margin. Both teams brought their A-game, making for an entertaining spectacle that kept us on the edge of our seats until the final"

While DaCreamist had some solid performances from Josh Jacobs, Lamar Jackson, and the Jets D/ST, it was ultimately Burrow This L's dynamic duo of Joe Burrow and the red-hot Evan McPherson that carried the day. McPherson's 16 points from the kicker spot is an absolute game-changer, and Burrow's 17.22 points were nothing to sneeze at either. Meanwhile, DaCreamist was let down by some duds like Dalton Schultz and Jake Elliott, who combined for a measly 11.1 points from the tight end and kicker positions. In the end, it was just enough for Burrow This L to squeak out the win in a thriller."
